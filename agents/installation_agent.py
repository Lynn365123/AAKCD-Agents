"""
Installation agent -- fourth agent in the kill chain (see the build guide).

Detection behaviour (kept to exactly ONE per the Week 6-7 scope cap):
    Inspect a scheduled-task/cron entry for persistence indicators
    commonly used by attackers to survive reboot (MITRE T1053.005,
    Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task).

Run it directly for a quick local test (writes to installation_alerts.jsonl,
does not touch Wazuh yet). `target` is a label identifying the scheduled
task sample -- if a matching file exists at tasks/<target>.txt it is read
as the telemetry, otherwise a canned suspicious-task sample is used so the
pipeline is testable before real crontab/schtasks polling is wired up:

    python -m agents.installation_agent sample-task-01
