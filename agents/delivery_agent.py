"""
Delivery agent -- second agent in the kill chain (see the build guide).

Detection behaviour (kept to exactly ONE per the Week 6-7 scope cap):
    Inspect an email's subject/body/sender/links for phishing indicators
    and flag suspicious delivery attempts (MITRE T1566.002, Phishing:
    Spearphishing Link).

Run it directly for a quick local test (writes to delivery_alerts.jsonl,
does not touch Wazuh yet). `target` is a label identifying the email --
if a matching sample file exists at emails/<target>.txt it is read as the
"inbox" telemetry, otherwise a canned suspicious sample is used so the
pipeline is testable before real mailbox access (e.g. Gmail API) is wired
up:

    python -m agents.delivery_agent sample-phish-01
