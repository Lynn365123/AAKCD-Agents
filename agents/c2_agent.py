"""
C2 (Command & Control) agent -- fifth and final kill-chain detection agent
(see the build guide). Scope was deliberately kept to the single simplest
detection to offset the Integration Lead's workload -- see the project
plan's team-structure notes.

Detection behaviour (kept to exactly ONE per the Week 6-7 scope cap):
    Inspect a network connection log entry for signs of C2 beaconing over
    a web protocol (MITRE T1071.001, Application Layer Protocol: Web
    Protocols).

Run it directly for a quick local test (writes to c2_alerts.jsonl, does
not touch Wazuh yet). `target` is a label identifying the connection log
sample -- if a matching file exists at connections/<target>.txt it is
read as the telemetry, otherwise a canned suspicious-beacon sample is
used so the pipeline is testable before real socket/connection auditing
is wired up:

    python -m agents.c2_agent sample-conn-01
