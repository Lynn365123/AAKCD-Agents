"""
Coordinator agent -- correlates alerts already written by the five
kill-chain detection agents (Recon, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation,
C2) by target_host, and uses the LLM to synthesize a single narrative
alert describing the full attack chain observed on that host.

Unlike the other five agents, the Coordinator has no MITRE technique of
its own and does not collect its own telemetry -- it reads the alert
logs the other agents have already written (see project plan Section 6,
Phase 3). In production this reads from Wazuh/OpenSearch instead of
local JSON files; for MVP/local testing it reads the same local log
files the other agents write to, which is why it must be run from the
same working directory (or same VM) those logs were written in.

Run it directly for a quick local test, after having run at least TWO of
the other agents against the SAME target_host, so there is something to
correlate (e.g. `python -m agents.recon_agent 192.168.88.129` followed
by `python -m agents.delivery_agent 192.168.88.129` -- note the C2/
Delivery/Exploitation/Installation agents accept any label as `target`,
so reusing an IP as the label works fine for testing correlation):
