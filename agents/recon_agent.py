"""
Reconnaissance agent -- the first agent to build (see the build guide).

Detection behaviour (kept to exactly ONE per the Week 6-7 scope cap):
    Scan a target IP and flag any open port running a service commonly
    abused for network reconnaissance / unauthenticated access (matches
    the reference report's own Recon agent test case: T1046).

Run it directly for a quick local test (writes to recon_alerts.jsonl,
does not touch Wazuh yet):

    python -m agents.recon_agent 192.168.88.129
